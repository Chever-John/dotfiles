# Key bindings
#
# Each binding is defined as an object with some properties. Most of the
# properties are optional. All of the alphabetical keys should have a letter for
# the `key` value such as `V`. Function keys are probably what you would expect
# as well (F1, F2, ..). The number keys above the main keyboard are encoded as
# `Key1`, `Key2`, etc. Keys on the number pad are encoded `Number1`, `Number2`,
# etc.  These all match the glutin::VirtualKeyCode variants.
#
# A list with all available `key` names can be found here:
# https://docs.rs/glutin/*/glutin/enum.VirtualKeyCode.html#variants
#
# Possible values for `mods`
# `Command`, `Super` refer to the super/command/windows key
# `Control` for the control key
# `Shift` for the Shift key
# `Alt` and `Option` refer to alt/option
#
# mods may be combined with a `|`. For example, requiring control and shift
# looks like:
#
# mods: Control|Shift
#
# The parser is currently quite sensitive to whitespace and capitalization -
# capitalization must match exactly, and piped items must not have whitespace
# around them.
#
# Either an `action`, `chars`, or `command` field must be present.
#   `action` must be one of `Paste`, `PasteSelection`, `Copy`, or `Quit`.
#   `chars` writes the specified string every time that binding is activated.
#     These should generally be escape sequences, but they can be configured to
#     send arbitrary strings of bytes.
#   `command` must be a map containing a `program` string, and `args` array of
#     strings. For example:
#     - { ... , command: { program: "alacritty", args: ["-e", "vttest"] } }

# 切记，下面这两个 keybindings 的配置，一定要跟随 tmux.conf 中的配置。
# 当 tmux.conf 配置如下之后：
# Split horiziontal and vertical splits, instead of % and ". We also open them
# in the same directory.  Because we use widescreens nowadays, opening a
# vertical split that takes half of the screen is not worth. For vertical we
# only open 100 lines width, for horizontal it's 20 columns.
# https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/21771
#bind-key v split-window -h -l 100 -c "#{?pane_path,#{s@^file.//@@:pane_path},#{pane_current_path}}"
#bind-key s split-window -v -l 30 -c "#{?pane_path,#{s@^file.//@@:pane_path},#{pane_current_path}}"
# 然后你在配置完下面两项配置之后，那么就会奏效。
